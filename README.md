## Project Description
Files Manager is designed to provide a platform where users can upload and view files, manage their accounts, and handle authentication seamlessly.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment to run JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and creating routes.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and message brokering.
- **Kue**: Priority job queue backed by Redis.
- **NoSQL**: Non-relational database design for scalability and flexibility.
